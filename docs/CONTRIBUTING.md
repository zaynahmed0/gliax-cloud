## Branching Model

We follow GitHub Flow, which is a lightweight, trunk-based branching model that emphasizes collaboration and rapid deployment.

### Branch Naming Convention

- Feature branches: `feature/<description>`
- Bug fixes: `fix/<description>`

Examples:
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `fix/login-validation`

### Workflow

1. Always branch off `main` for new work
2. Create short-lived feature branches
3. Open a Pull Request for review
4. Merge via fast-forward only
5. Delete the branch after merging

### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused and small
- Include clear descriptions of changes
- Reference related issues
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Get at least one review approval
- Merge only via fast-forward

### Important Notes

- No long-lived forks
- Keep branches up to date with main
- Delete branches after merging
- Squash commits if needed before merging

## Development Process

1. Create a new branch from main
2. Make your changes
3. Commit with clear messages
4. Push your branch
5. Open a Pull Request
6. Address review comments
7. Merge when approved
